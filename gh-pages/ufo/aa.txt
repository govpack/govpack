The dataset repository is a collaborative space for humanitarians, and data sources could be as varied as UNHCR, WFP, NGOs, or the local government, among others. The HDX team will be also sharing a large amount of pre-crisis data (e.g. GDP, under-5 mortality rates) that we have been collecting in collaboration with ScraperWiki.
