WARNING MAY CONTAIN TRACES OF NUTS

What I want to know is what license all theses licenses are licensed under? 
And if any of the words mean anything at all? Like under what terms can one 
distribute the License itself? Surely the license itself is intellectual property 
and NEEDS to be "protected" by an additional set of pointless words.

May a million lolcats leave a lot of dander on your doona, 
if you ain't in our good books!! You need to stock up on our cosmic karmic indulgences™ NOW 
woe betide anyone with out them. We'll sick King Tut on you. 
Sick King tut' tut' himself, and he'll say: ~ "tut tut, tut, on YOU".

No part™ of™ this™ reproduction™ may™ be™ reproduced™ 
in™ any™ form™ without™ written™ permission™ from™ govpack@gmail.com

Also at the VERY same time we are issuing Universal Patents 
on the latin letters a-z (YEAH that's right bitch you're gonna have to start typing in ALL CAPS FROM NOW ON)
and the number 3 plus the plus symbol "+" and asterix "*" because we love the comix, 

With legal representation brought to you by the children's television workshop, 
the under fives all stars **** team, they'll s'plain it to you. And you can't 
leave the table until you've eaten your vegetables.


Also, legally speaking, should A license specify what encoding it needs to be stored in? 
lolcat prefers utf-7.5, but like the hodgetwins say "do whatever the F@%#!! you wanna do!!"

Or would a link to the online version of the license be okay? AND what about for all the mofos 
who don't speak English? should we include 100+ other translations? Or should we just remain Anglo Centric, 
flat earth, xenophobic, narrow minded, pig head mofos ourselves? Then translations and the translators work, 
surely will also have licenses and copyright notices attached. What license should apply to the "license of the license" 
and will that license need a license too (of course it would). Who here WRITES legaleeze and wants to own up for 
crimes against humanity? Timewasting and causing all sorts of unnecessary anxiety? 
Pile up words that amount to nothing? Can we, legally sepaking, make backup copies of the license itself? 
Would one be twice as protected? if they included two or more copies of that license? Would 10x be sufficent? 100x? 1e9x? 
Could that be a new type of best practice? I mean I don't feel that protected, how about you?

Also you MUST know that MIT does not want you to use their logo 
or NAME, or such to assocate them with your product, as quoted below...  

from http://openpds.media.mit.edu/documents/System_Rules.pdf

"""Legal	Notices

So, by USING one of their licesnses you are breaking another of them. (BREAKING BAD)
Or do you HAVE prior written consent from MIT? And you CAN'T get prior
written permission because a license to the effect of the above will
have preceeded the MIT software license, because ALL stuffy academics 
everywhere ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO protect their ivory towers by wrapping them in 
more and more pointless words. So EVERYONE using the MIT LICENSE is in breach of 
the preceeding LICENSE (as quoted above). So I suggest you move to the 
LOLCAT™ LICENSE™ version™ 1.21.11 it's WAY better - legally and morally speaking. 

Lolcats over lawyers -- hellz years. P.S. we will be updating it by incrementing the 
SEM VERZ. every millisecond or so (a' la' npm package.json, just to keep issacs happy) 
But don't worry it will be in github version control!! welcome to git hell, everybody. 
Should I rebase now? Saving a file just got SO hard. And GPL isn't enough you've got 
to have fifty million versions of such (but don't worry they've got version numbers 
so you can excpect more, which suggests that something IS WRONG with the ones before, 
so expect more). LOLCAT is calling BS on ALL of it. Every LOLCAT is gonna make a paw print. 
PAWS for the cause, hell yeah-A.

If we print out a portion of the source code do we need to print out a copy of 
the license to go with it? or only a portion? If so which portion or portions, and
in which font? And if we use letters and other symbols from the alphabet, 
who owns the IP on those and what do we owe them ~ only the lolcat knows.

©™ LOLCAT™ LICENSE™ version™ 1.21.11 takes SOLE and FULL,
and soulful, legal, environmental, personal, karmic, 
responsibiltity! For EVERYTHING that happens, on all levels, 
by whatever chain of causeation, every WHERE and every WHEN
[retro active] from WAY back then, until the heat death 
of the universe. Make that the MULTIVERSE (bump the semver, lol). 
Everything is binding and attributable.
LOLCAT is completely responsible.
