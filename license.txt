What I want to know is what license all theses licenses are licensed under? 
And if any of the words mean anything at all? Like under what terms can one 
distribute the License itself? Surely the license itself is intellectual property 
and NEEDS to be "protected" by an additional set of pointless words.

No part™ of™ this™ reproduction™ may™ be™ reproduced™

May a million lolcats leave a lot of dander on your doona, 
if you aren't in our good books!! You need to stock up on our 
cosmic karmic indulgences™ NOW woe betide anyone with out them. 
We'll sick King Tut on you. (sick King tut' tut' himself, 
and he'll say: ~ "tut tut, tut, to YOU").

By the power of the pharaohs/pharos themselves at the VERY same time 
we are issuing Universal Patents on the latin letters a-z 
yeah that's right bitch you're gonna have to start typing in ALL CAPS FROM NOW ON!!
and the number 14 plus the plus symbol "+" and asterix "*" because we love comix. 

with legal representation brought to you by the children's television workshop, 
the under fives all star team **** 
~they'll "s'plain" it to you. And you can't leave the table until you've eaten your vegetables.
the brocolii cores - yes you must eat the brocolli cores.

Also, legally speaking, should a license specify what encoding it needs to be stored in? 
lolcat prefers utf-7.5 ;-) but like the hodgetwins say "do whatever the F@%#!! you wanna do!!"

Or would a link to the online version of the license be okay? And what about for all the other white nigger mofos 
who don't speak English? Should we include 100+ other language translations as well? Or should we just remain Anglo Centric, 
flat earth, xenophobic, narrow minded, racist, pig headed white nigger mofos ourselves? Because by including a license only in one 
language you are strongly impling that you don't care about the rest of the world, that they are not valuable or deserving enough, 
ie. you are being a racist pig - unless you are of the opionion that such licenses are pointless BS (which they are) 
in which case you are sparing them the indignity, and are only giving that to your own kind of englishspeaking nation, 
in which case you are a timewasting traitor to your own kind, i.e. of the unkind kind. 
Then the translations and the translators work [they would have to be highly trained white nigger mofos, knowing two or more
natural langauges plus local and international law, plus IT related domain spefic+general knowledge as well, 
these would be no ordinary white nigger mofos, they may even be black, because if they weren't you'd 
also be an even bigger racist, and their IP surely would also have licenses and copyright notices 
attached otherwise you'd be an even BIGGER racist white nigger mofo. In which case the question IS 
still be along the lines of: 
  "What license should apply to the "license of the license"?" 

and would that license need a license too? (of course it would). 
Who here writes legaleeze and wants to own up for crimes against humanity? 
Pile-ing up more and MORE words that amount to nothing? 
Timewasting and making people all anxious and worried about all lots of unknown legal mumbo jumbo? 
How FREE can it be if it's got all those crappy words attached? 
Not free from sleazy, subversive, agenda riddled, legalistic BS that's for sure. 
All those words and we're still left guessing for example can we, legally sepaking, 
make backup copies of the license itself? 
and would I be twice as protected, If I included two or more copies of that license? 
Would 10 copies be sufficent? 100x? 1e99x? Could that be a new type of best practice? 
I mean I don't feel that protected - now, how about you?

Does the fact that there are so many licenses point to the fact that 
there is some central failure of the whole conceptual mess? 

Also you MUST know that MIT does not want you to use their logo 
or NAME, or such to assocate them with your product, as quoted below...

"Legal Notices

So, by USING the MIT software licesnse you are breaking the above license.AND BREAKING IT BAD. 
("You may not use the MIT name in any of its forms", and there it is littered
thru and associated and used to promote every repo you ever made)
Or do you HAVE prior written consent from MIT? And you CAN'T get prior written permission 
because a license to the effect of the above will have PRECEEDED the MIT software license, 
is that a time machinein your garage or are you just happy to see me, since ALL stuffy academics 
everywhere ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO protect their ivory towers by wrapping them in more and more
and more and more and more pointless words (aka the Internet). So EVERYONE using the MIT LICENSE 
is in breach of the preceeding LICENSE quoted above. And Why would you want your 
product associated with that shit hole anyway? or advertise for THEM in any way, which 
they expressly forbid, in very clear terms as per the above -- trademark law etc. So I suggest you 
move all your projects to the LOLCAT™ LICENSE™ version™ 1.21.11 -- it's WAY,WAY,WAY better 
legally and morally speaking. 


Lolcats over lawyers, hellz yers. P.S. we will be updating it by incrementing the 
SEM VER on our lols every millisecond or so (a' la' npm package.json, just to keep issacs happy) 
But don't worry it will be in github version control!! welcome to git hell, everybody. 
Should I rebase now? Saving a file just got hard. GPL isn't enough we NEED to  
to have MANY different versions thereof (but don't worry they've got version numbers 
so you can excpect MORE, which suggests that something WASN'T QUITE RIGHT with the ones 
before, so expect MORE, i.e. they were feeding you shit before, and they are are feeding 
you shit now). LOLCAT is calling BS on ALL of it. Every LOLCAT is gonna make a 
paw print. PAWS for the cause, hell yeah-a.

Now, if we print out a portion of the source code do we need to print out a copy of 
the license to go with it? or only a portion? If so which portion or portions? and
More importantly in which font? And if you print a license in a font, does the license 
of the font have to BE a compatable license, since the source code for the actual 
font is not readable, or even availbale, even though the font may be readable, but has 
been made into a compliled product, or true type font which may be true by name but 
mainly and namely and insanely isn't true by nature, because it isn't very open source 
is it? and therefore must be somewhat wrong because someone some where is paying the 
makers to make it, so they can eat, and Richard Stallman IS NOT -- so they may have to eat 
their toe nails, leagally speaking, so they may have more energy to tell me which license 
and which font would one need to use fix this?? so we can print it out or even read it 
correctly, legally speaking, in this case not the "license to the license", but the license 
to the license to the license, and if we use letters and other symbols from the alphabet, 
who owns the IP on those and what do we owe them? 

~ only the lolcat knows.
