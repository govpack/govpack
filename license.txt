What i want to know is what license all theses licenses are licensed under? 
And if any of the words mean anything at all? Like under what terms can one 
distribute the License itself? Surely the license itself is intellectual property 
and NEEDS to be "protected" by an additional set of pointless words.

May a million lolcats leave a lot of dander on your doona, if you aren't in our good books!! You need to stock up on our cosmic karmic indulgences™ NOW -- woe betide anyone 
with out them. We'll sick King Tut on you. (Sick King tut' tut' himself, and he'll say "tut tut, tut, on YOU", lol).

No part™ of™ this™ reproduction™ may™ be™ reproduced™ in™ any™ form™ without™ written™ permission™ from™ govpack@gmail.com

Also at the VERY same time we are issuing Universal Patents, 
on the letters a-z, the number 14, and the children's television workshop.
YEAH that's right bitch you're gonna have to start typing in ALL CAPS FROM NOW ON,  
Also (legally speaking) should  a license specify what encoding it needs to be stored in? 
like utf-7.5, etc or would a link to the online version sufficent? And what about
for all the mofos who don't speak english should we include 20+ other translations? 
Or should we just remain anglo centric, flat earth, narrow minded mofos ourselves? 
Then translations and the translators work should also have licenses and copyright notices attached. 
What license should apply to the "license of the license" and would that too need a license. 
Who here WRITES legaleeze and wants to own up for crimes against humanity? Timewasting, Causing all sorts
of unnecessary anxiety. Can we make backup copies of the license itself AND would it be twice as protected?
if we included two or more copies of the license. Would 10x be sufficent, I mean I don't feel that protected,
how about you?

Also you must know that MIT does not want you to use their logo 
or name, or such to assocate them with your product...

So, by using one of their licesnses you are breaking another of them. (BREAKING BAD)
Or do YOU HAVE prior written consent from MIT? And you can't get prior
written permission because a license to the effect of the above will
have preceeded the MIT software license, since ALL stuffy academics 
everywhere HAVE to protect their ivory towers by wrapping them in 
more and more pointless words. So EVERYONE using the MIT LICENSE is in breach of 
the preceeding LEGAL NOTICE, LICENSE (as quoted above). So I suggest you move to the 
LOLCAT™ LICENSE™ version™ 1.21.11 it's better legally and morally speaking. 
Lolcats over lawyers -- hellz years. P.S. we will be updating it by incrementing the 
SEM VERZ. every millisecond or so (al la, npm package.json to keep issacs happy) 
but don't worry it will be in github version control (welcome to git hell). 
GPL isn't enough you've got to have fifty million versions of such. LOLCAT is calling
BS on all of it. Every LOLCAT is gonna make a paw print. PAWS for the cause, yeah-A.

And if we print out a portion of the source code do we need to print out a copy of 
the license to go with it? or only a portion? if so which portion? or portions? 
And if we use letters and other symbols from the alphabet, who owns the intellectual 
property on those and what do we owe them ~ only the lolcat knows.
