govpack is a command line tool (and node module) that seeks out the metadata
for ALL available data sets on a given CKAN endpoint, namely.... (X=0|1|2)


0 http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/current_package_list_with_resources

1 https://data.qld.gov.au/3/action/current_package_list_with_resources

2 https://data.gov.au/api/3/action/current_package_list_with_resources


CLI Usage:

     govpack {fetch:X} --> makes X.js module.exports=BigPackageList
     govpack {filter:X} --> makes X.txt filtered JSONP IIII(filtered_csv_metadata)
     govpack {download:X} --> downloads ./CSV/1.csv, ./CSV/2.csv,,, ./CSV/111.csv

the commands need to be run in that order because they depend on the previous result
results are saved in the same folder as index.js ie in your global "./node_modules/govpack/index.js" folder
downloaded "node_modules/govpack/format/1...n.format" files match up with the metadata in X.txt


###Output paths will be improved
note: result paths will get changed to "node_modules/govpack/X/format/1...n.format" and have an option to
put the results in a directory of your choice, which will be tidier and better for more ckans etc. With the
X moved up to directory level, X.js and X.txt will have a common name like a.txt and b.txt for each.

###From your node code: 

    GP=require('govpack');
    GP({fetch:0},function(){console.log('Done!!')})
    .....which returns....->
    Please be patient while we fetch from API#0
    Downloading:
    http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/current_package_list_with_resources
    SavingAs:
    C:/A/N/node_modules/govpack/0.js



####{filter:X ,format:'XYZ'}
As an option you may wish to set the format for the filter step 
to filter for some other filetype 

    govpack {filter:0 ,format:'KML'}
    txt|xlsx|jpg|json|html|png|pdf|xls|cvs|gif|xml|
    rdf|hdf5|kml|pptx|docx|doc|odp|dat|jar|zip|shp|etc

would all be okay format:'XYZ' (case insensitive) values to try 
but by far CSV is the most popular default.

#a.htm 
a.htm (shown in the image above) is the page that uses the JSONP 0.txt, and displays the filtered JSONP metadata generated by govpack from the CKAN records, namely... 

* links to the actual CSV files, (right click and choose Save File As)
* CSV file size [where available]
* table heading/description
* field names (hased and colourized so all of the same fields light up in the same color)
* field types
* column and row counts

a.htm should be useful to look at,as a sample of the final ouput. I wanted to do search and autocomplete on the field names, this is now possible :-) also CKAN has many GET verbs (including one that does SQL queries) so with our refined JSONP metatata one could genarate other ajax calls, from a web page, to open up the data even further.

###With the power of X (a simple integer as the primary key) more CKAN's can be added

     govpack {filter:X,format:'XLS'}

 presently in the source code they are referenced at:

    CK[0]={url:'http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/'}  // the demo data set as used by the CKAN docs
    CK[1]={url:'https://data.qld.gov.au/api/3/action/'} //the state catalog of datasets
    CK[2]={url:'https://data.gov.au/api/3/action/'}    //the national catalog of datasets 
    CK[99]={url:'https://some_CKAN_action_endpoint/'} // ie ADD some more
    // this CK[] array will probably end up in a seperate config file

objectified so we can describe them further and add more

#### NOW #2 (data.gov.au) is big and FAILS as a single request 

     the code has some in progress (INCOMPLETE) calls 
     to fetch it as several pagenated sub requests (todo)
     namely GetBiggerList(x,cb){/*conglomerate page-enated package lists*/}

#### at one stage npm was not making the corect govpack.cmd or shell script
#### but as someone kindly pointed out the following 2 fixes worked!!

     1) "bin": {"govpack": "index.js"}, /*add to your package.json*/
     2)  and Add 
             #!/usr/bin/env node  
             to the top of your index.js file
    funnily enough the shebang is useful on windows!!


    "C:/A/N/node.exe" "C:/A/B/2/9/Ax/20/index.js" {fetch:1}
    (works for me) but govpack {fetch:1} is better since your paths will vary

index.js has code that should make govpack to work as both a Command Line tool AND a module

    if(require.main === module){/*Use from the CommandLine*/}
    else{module.exports=init/*work as a module*/}


####Finally (get me the data)
after having run govpack {fetch:0} and govpack {filter:0} you may also call

    govpack {download:0} 

to download the filtered CSV file set from to disc



###more endpoints/fixes and addtions are wecolme

| CSV Tables    | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| but what's?   | **inside**    | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | ????????      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
